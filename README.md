# crb-roadside-code

This repo contains software and sample data for automated roadside surveys coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) damage. 
The **rawdata** folder contains georeferenced image files in **jpg** format.
The software uses an object detector to find all coconut palms within the images to assign a -level damage index to each one. 
A second object detector searches for v-shaped cuts in coconut palm fronds (a distinctive symptom of CRB damage).

All development was done using Python 3.6.9 on a GPU-equipped laptop running Ubuntu 18.0.6 LTS.

Code is contained in the following Jupyter notebooks:

* **code/run_all.ipynb** is the main program. It simply is runs the following notebooks.
* **code/extract_gps_data.ipnb** extracts GPS coordinates from each image in the **rawdata** folder and 
savesresults in **rawdata/gps-data.csv**.
* **code/detect_crb_damage.ipynb** runs the object detectors and saves results in **output/detected_objects.xml**.
* **code/create_db.ipynb** uses data from **rawdata/gps-data.csv** and **output/detected_objects.xml** to create 
a SpatiaLite database (default name: **output/results.db**).  

The resulting database, **output/results.db**, is used as the datasource for an interactive web maps generated by **QGIS**.
